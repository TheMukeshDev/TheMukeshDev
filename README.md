## Hi there 👋



## 💼 About Me
I'm a passionate **B.Tech Computer Science student** and **Full-Stack Bot Developer** from Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India. I'm a problem-solver with a deep interest in **Python** and **Software Development**. Currently pursuing my B.Tech at **Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University** (2025-2029).

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on the cricket field! I'm always looking for the next challenge to build something great together.
